# R Skills Overview

## 1. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**

- **dplyr**: A grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.
- **tidyr**: Tools to help you tidy your data; makes it easier to work with messy data.
- **data.table**: An extension of `data.frame` that provides fast aggregation of large datasets, fast ordered joins, and fast add/modify/delete of columns by reference.

## 2. **Data Visualization**

- **ggplot2**: A system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics, which provides a coherent system for describing and building graphs.
- **plotly**: An interactive graphing library that makes it easy to create interactive plots and dashboards.
- **shiny**: A framework for building interactive web applications directly from R.

## 3. **Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning**

- **caret**: A unified interface for creating and comparing the performance of machine learning models.
- **randomForest**: An implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, used for classification and regression.
- **glmnet**: A package that fits a generalized linear model via penalized maximum likelihood.

## 4. **Time Series Analysis**

- **xts/zoo**: Tools for working with regularly and irregularly spaced time series data in R.
- **forecast**: Tools for time series forecasting, including exponential smoothing and ARIMA models.
- **prophet**: A forecasting tool for time series data that is particularly strong in handling seasonal effects.

## 5. **Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **tm**: A framework for text mining applications within R, providing tools for text processing and term-document matrices.
- **quanteda**: A package for managing, processing, and analyzing text data; includes fast and flexible tools for creating document-feature matrices.
- **tidytext**: Integrates textual data into the tidyverse framework for easier manipulation and analysis.

## 6. **Web Scraping and APIs**

- **rvest**: Simplifies the process of scraping web pages, providing tools to read HTML and extract data.
- **httr**: A package to handle HTTP requests, making it easy to communicate with web APIs and parse responses.
- **jsonlite**: A robust tool for parsing and generating JSON within R.

## 7. **Reporting and Reproducible Research**

- **RMarkdown**: Combines R with Markdown to produce documents that include code, output, and text.
- **knitr**: A package that enables dynamic report generation, allowing you to include the results of your R code directly in your documents.
- **Sweave**: A tool that allows the integration of R code into LaTeX documents for reproducible research.

## 8. **Database Interaction**

- **DBI**: A database interface definition for communication between R and relational database management systems.
- **RPostgreSQL/RMySQL/RSQLite**: Specific drivers for connecting R to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases respectively.
- **dplyr with Databases**: Extending `dplyr` capabilities to work directly with databases, allowing you to manipulate remote tables as if they were local data frames.

## 9. **Parallel Computing**

- **parallel**: Base R support for parallel computation on multiple cores or nodes.
- **foreach**: An extension that allows for easy execution of code in parallel, loop by loop.
- **snow**: A simple network of workstations package that facilitates parallel computing by running R code on multiple nodes.

## 10. **Development and Collaboration Tools**

- **RStudio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes coding, debugging, and visualization easy and intuitive.
- **GitHub/GitLab with R**: Tools for version control and collaborative coding, especially through the `usethis` and `devtools` packages.
