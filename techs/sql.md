# SQL Skills Overview

## 1. **Basic Querying**

- **SELECT Statements**: Writing simple to complex queries to retrieve data from one or more tables.
- **JOINs**: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOINs).
- **WHERE Clauses**: Filtering records based on specified conditions.

## 2. **Advanced Querying**

- **Subqueries**: Embedding queries within other queries to perform complex operations.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplifying complex queries by breaking them into simpler, temporary result sets.
- **Window Functions**: Performing calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, using functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and LEAD/LAG.

## 3. **Data Manipulation**

- **INSERT**: Adding new rows of data to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modifying existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Removing rows from a table.

## 4. **Data Definition**

- **CREATE Statements**: Defining new tables, views, and other database objects.
- **ALTER Statements**: Modifying the structure of existing database objects (e.g., adding or dropping columns).
- **DROP Statements**: Deleting database objects such as tables, views, and indexes.

## 5. **Performance Optimization**

- **Indexes**: Creating and managing indexes to optimize query performance.
- **Query Optimization**: Techniques to enhance query performance, including indexing strategies, query refactoring, and execution plan analysis.
- **Normalization**: Structuring databases to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## 6. **Transactions and Concurrency**

- **Transactions**: Grouping a series of operations into a single, atomic unit that can be committed or rolled back.
- **ACID Properties**: Ensuring database transactions are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable.
- **Isolation Levels**: Understanding and managing the trade-offs between consistency and performance in concurrent transactions.

## 7. **Stored Procedures and Functions**

- **Stored Procedures**: Writing and managing reusable blocks of SQL code that can be executed with parameters.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Creating custom functions for specific operations within SQL queries.
- **Triggers**: Automatically executing a specified block of code in response to certain events on a table or view.

## 8. **Database Security**

- **User Management**: Creating and managing database users and roles, and assigning permissions.
- **Encryption**: Implementing encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Writing secure queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## 9. **Reporting and Data Analysis**

- **Aggregations**: Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.) to summarize data.
- **Pivot Tables**: Transforming row-level data into a summary format using PIVOT and UNPIVOT operations.
- **Views**: Creating and managing virtual tables to simplify complex queries and secure data access.

## 10. **Database Administration**

- **Backup and Restore**: Strategies for data backup, disaster recovery, and restoring databases from backups.
- **Database Migration**: Techniques for moving data between different database systems or versions.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regular database health checks, including analyzing logs, checking for fragmentation, and performance tuning.

## 11. **Development and Collaboration Tools**

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: A comprehensive tool for managing and developing SQL Server databases.
- **pgAdmin**: A feature-rich tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **Version Control with SQL**: Techniques for managing SQL scripts and database changes using version control systems like Git.
