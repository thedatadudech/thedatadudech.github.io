# Python Skills Overview

## 1. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**

- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library, offering data structures like DataFrames for managing and analyzing large datasets efficiently.
- **NumPy**: Provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## 2. **Data Visualization**

- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Plotly**: A graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online.

## 3. **Machine Learning**

- **Scikit-learn**: A simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning, particularly deep learning, developed by Google.
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

## 4. **Big Data Processing**

- **PySpark**: A Python API for Spark, enabling large-scale data processing with a Pythonic interface.
- **Dask**: A parallel computing library that scales Python code from laptops to large clusters.

## 5. **Web Development**

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
- **Django**: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## 6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **NLTK**: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.
- **spaCy**: An open-source software library for advanced NLP in Python, designed specifically for production use.

## 7. **Automation and Web Scraping**

- **Selenium**: A portable framework for testing web applications, allowing you to automate browsers.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting data from them.

## 8. **Database Interaction**

- **SQLAlchemy**: An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, providing a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns.
- **Psycopg2**: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python, enabling communication between Python programs and a PostgreSQL database.

## 9. **Cloud Computing**

- **Boto3**: The Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, providing an easy way to integrate with AWS services like S3, EC2, and DynamoDB.
- **Google Cloud Client Libraries**: These libraries provide you with idiomatic ways to interact with Google Cloud services.

## 10. **Testing**

- **PyTest**: A robust testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, or UI.
- **unittest**: Pythonâ€™s built-in library for testing, offering a lot of customization options for writing and running tests.

## 11. **Development and Collaboration Tools**

- **Jupyter**: An open-source project that provides an interactive web-based interface for notebooks, code, and data visualization.
- **GitHub/GitLab**: Platforms for version control and collaborative coding, allowing you to manage and review code repositories.
